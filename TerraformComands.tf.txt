# Types
The Terraform language uses the following types for its values:

#string: 
A sequence of Unicode characters representing some text, like "hello".
#number: 
A numeric value. The number type can represent both whole numbers like 15 and fractional values like 6.283185.
#bool: 
A boolean value, either true or false. bool values can be used in conditional logic.
#list (or tuple): 
A sequence of values, like ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]. Elements in a list or tuple are identified by consecutive whole numbers, starting with zero.
#map (or object): 
A group of values identified by named labels, like {name = "Mabel", age = 52}.

# Example
variable "image_id" {
  type = string
}

variable "availability_zone_names" {
  type    = list(string)
  default = ["us-west-1a"]
}

variable "docker_ports" {
  type = list(object({
    internal = number
    external = number
    protocol = string
  }))
  default = [
    {
      internal = 8300
      external = 8300
      protocol = "tcp"
    }
  ]
}
